<h1 align="center"> <p style="color:#ff7f50;"> Woah! What a wonderful world! </p> </h1>


I explore the sky while working, and in my spare time, I search for what is left undiscovered for me from feelings and experiences on the Earth!

I love to explore new places and randomly walk or bike around cities to find antique bookstores, random treasures in old forgotten stores, or a beautiful silent spot to sit and read and watch the sunset.

I also extremely enjoy making lists of everything I like. I make thousands of playlists for the sound of all the places I've been walking in.
On the freezing or scorching days (Which actually is quite common in Iranian summers), I like to sit inside with good music and a good book or a poet and an occasional (non-alcoholic) drink or start a random in-door hobby. So far, I have tried playing piano, painting, Vitra (glass painting), yoga, embroidery, and making salty cookies. (Let me just point out that I'm not a professional or even good in any of these:-") 

I sometimes write short reviews in English and Persian on the books I read, which you can find on my Goodreads.
Also, find my public playlists on my Spotify.

Besides, I quite enjoy debating all the life questions over a cup of coffee or tea or on a long hike! So reach me out if you like to chat ;)
